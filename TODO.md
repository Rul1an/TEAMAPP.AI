### ðŸ†• In Progress â€“ Exercise Library Screen Refactor (Q3 2025)

ID: **refactor-exercise-library**

Objective: Split `exercise_library_screen.dart` (â‰ˆ 1.1 k LOC) into a clean, testable structure following 2025 best-practices.

Incremental Steps (TDD-based)
1. **Unit tests â€“ ExerciseLibraryController**
   * Write tests for search filter, intensity filter, and reset behaviour.
2. **Extract ExerciseLibraryController**
   * Move filter/search logic from screen into `exercise_library_controller.dart` (ChangeNotifier + Riverpod provider).
3. **Widget tests â€“ SearchBar & FilterBar**
   * Ensure chips/dropdowns update controller state.
4. **Extract UI widgets**
   * `search_bar.dart`, `filter_bar.dart`, `morphocycle_banner.dart`, `exercise_tab_view.dart`.
5. **Refactor ExerciseLibraryScreen**
   * Keep only Scaffold, TabBar, body composition; ensure < 300 LOC.
6. **Golden/widget tests â€“ main flows**
   * Search + filter flow golden snapshot; list updates.
7. **Cleanup & docs update**
   * Remove obsolete providers, update `LARGE_FILE_REFACTOR_PLAN_Q3_2025.md`, ensure analyzer 0-issues.

Exit criteria:
* `exercise_library_screen.dart` < 300 LOC, widgets < 200 LOC each.
* Controller unit-tests â‰¥ 90 % statement coverage.
* All tests green; CI passes.

### WebAssembly (Skwasm) Compatibility Roadmap â€“ Target Q4 2025

> See Flutter docs: https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/wasm

**Step 0 â€“ Unblock CI (DONE / In-progress)**
- [ ] CI: Switch mandatory web build to CanvasKit (`flutter build web --release --web-renderer canvaskit`). *(Task id: ci-switch-canvaskit â€“ in progress)*

**Phase 1 â€“ Dependency Audit**
- [ ] List all direct & transitive packages that import `dart:html`, `dart:js`, or `dart:ffi` (e.g. `win32`, `ffi`, `flutter_secure_storage_web`, `share_plus`, `connectivity_plus`). *(Task id: wasm-dep-audit)*
- [ ] Identify web-safe alternatives or create stub implementations.

**Phase 2 â€“ Conditional Imports & Stubs**
- [ ] Introduce conditional imports (`if (dart.library.js_interop)` / `if (dart.library.ffi)` stubs).
- [ ] Replace insecure packages with `package:web` + `dart:js_interop` where needed.

**Phase 3 â€“ CI Workflow**
- [ ] Add optional job `Build Web (wasm)` using `flutter build web --wasm` (allowed_to_fail until green). *(Task id: wasm-workflow-matrix)*
- [ ] Configure Netlify/Cloud Run with COEP: `credentialless` and COOP: `same-origin` headers for multi-threading. *(Task id: wasm-server-headers)*

**Exit Criteria**
* CanvasKit build remains green.
* Skwasm build compiles and passes smoke tests in Chrome 119+.
* No `dart:ffi`, `dart:html`, or `dart:js` errors in Wasm job.
* Performance benchmark â‰¥ CanvasKit.
