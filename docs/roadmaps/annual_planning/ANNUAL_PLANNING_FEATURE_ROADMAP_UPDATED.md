## üéØ Goals & Best Practices Integration

### Primary Goals
1. **Professional Season Planning**: Like top European youth academies
2. **Tactical Periodization**: Based on V√≠tor Frade's methodology used by Mourinho
3. **KNVB Standards**: Dutch youth development best practices for JO17
4. **Seamless Integration**: Connect all aspects of team management
5. **Scientific Foundation**: Evidence-based training load management

### Research-Based Best Practices

#### 1. Tactical Periodization (V√≠tor Frade Model)
**Core Principles:**
- **Specificity**: All training relates to game situations
- **Complex Progression**: From simple to complex tactical scenarios
- **Morphocycle Structure**: 4-day training cycle with specific emphases
- **Integrated Development**: Physical, technical, tactical, mental simultaneously

**Morphocycle Structure:**
- **Day +1 (Sunday)**: Recovery and active restoration (30-40% intensity)
- **Day +2 (Tuesday)**: High-intensity tactical work (85-95% intensity)
- **Day +3 (Thursday)**: Medium-intensity technical-tactical (70-80% intensity)
- **Day +4 (Friday)**: Low-intensity activation/set pieces (50-60% intensity)
- **Match Day (Saturday)**: Competition (100% intensity)

#### 2. KNVB Youth Development Standards
**Age-Appropriate Periodization for JO17:**
- **Training Frequency**: 3-4 sessions per week, 75-90 minutes each
- **Focus Areas**: Technical refinement (30%), tactical understanding (40%), physical development (20%), mental (10%)
- **Season Structure**: August prep ‚Üí September-December building ‚Üí January-April peak ‚Üí May-June development

**Dutch Calendar Integration:**
- **School Holidays**: Herfstvakantie (week 43), Kerstvakantie (weeks 52-2), Voorjaarsvakantie (week 8), Meivakantie (week 18)
- **Competition Periods**: Najaarscompetitie (Sept-Dec), Voorjaarscompetitie (Jan-May)
- **Tournament Phases**: District, Regional, National levels

#### 3. Modern Load Management
**Training Load Variables:**
- **External Load**: Distance, sprints, technical actions per session
- **Internal Load**: RPE (6-20 scale), heart rate zones, subjective wellness
- **Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio**: 4-week rolling average for injury prevention
- **Recovery Monitoring**: Sleep quality, nutrition, stress levels

  static double calculateSessionLoad(int rpe, int durationMinutes) {
    return rpe * durationMinutes;
  }

  // Calculate acute:chronic workload ratio
  static double calculateACWR(List<double> last28Days) {
    final acute = last28Days.take(7).reduce((a, b) => a + b) / 7;
    final chronic = last28Days.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / 28;
    return acute / chronic;
  }

  // Assess injury risk based on ACWR
  static InjuryRisk assessInjuryRisk(double acwr) {
    if (acwr < 0.8) return InjuryRisk.underloaded;
    if (acwr > 1.3) return InjuryRisk.high;
